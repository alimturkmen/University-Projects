<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   In this project, you are expected to design and develop a program that can be used to simulate
transportations done using freight trains.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Description</h3>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >You are going to simulate a transportation scenario. According to this scenario, you are given
several cities. In each city, there exists a train station which consists of two garages; one for
locomotives and the other for waggons. Your task consists of several missions. Each mission
requires you to assemble a simulated train at the specified city and by following the given route,
arrive at the destination city, leaving and taking waggons from the cities you visit. You are
expected to create a program that reads the input about the trains from the input files and after
completing the missions, produces an output file exhibiting the final state of the stations at each
city.

      <li class="itemize">In a station, there are two garages: a waggon garage and a locomotive garage.

      <li class="itemize">A waggon garage keeps the waggons in the station.

      <li class="itemize">In our scenario, waggon garages are modeled as stacks that are following the last-in-first-out
      policy.

      <li class="itemize">In  our  scenario,  locomotive  garages  are  modeled  as  priority  queues.  When  asked  for  a
      locomotive, they should retrieve the most powerful locomotive inside the garage.

      <li class="itemize">The initial configuration of locomotive garages in each city is given in <span
